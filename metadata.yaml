description: This 1899 novel, of which Hope had a very high opinion, represented a
  change in his fictional dynamic, from a focus on adventure and intrigue to the no-less
  riveting dramas of internal conflict and development. A young king learns the wisdom
  of self-discipline and restraint as he leads his country through troubled times.
